# Cause of America

The role of Cause of America is to enable, facilitate and support citizen grassroots action to restore trust in local elections.  It’s about building a network of individuals, organizations, and partners who can learn from each other and work together to solve the most pressing issue facing our nation **“free and fair elections.”**

Cause of America is unique.  It’s not about building an empire.  It’s not a top-down command-and-control organization attempting to control the work of citizens or grassroots groups.  **It’s the opposite.**  A lean, nimble networked organization that provides best-in-class advice and resources to the people on-the-ground who know best how to govern themselves!
